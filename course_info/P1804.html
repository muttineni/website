<h2>
Please read <i>ALL</i> of this important information about your class: ISPD-02.
</h2>
<p>
We are looking forward to the upcoming course in <i><b>Catholic School Development/Advancement, PART II</b></i>, which will <b>begin on Thursday, August 30, 2018, at 10:30 AM CENTRAL TIME</b>.
</p>
<p>
As you know, this on-line course is presented by The University of Dayton/Institute for Pastoral Initiatives and the Institute for School and Parish Development (ISPD). Students who complete the course will receive two Continuing Education Credits (CEUs) and a Certificate of Completion from The University of Dayton.
</p>
<p>
Please note, that this is not the course -- the actual course is not on this website; it will be presented on the GoToWebinar website. We are simply providing you with registration information here.
</p>
<p>
In order to complete the registration and get ready for the first class, please <b>make sure you have done the following:</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Paid the enrollment fee, which can be done on this UD website where you registered. If you are planning to pay by check before the course begins, please e-mail Laura Franklin: <a href="mailto:lfranklin1@udayton.edu">

Ordered the textbook and the workbook we will be using from NCEA - <b><i>25 Lessons Learned in 25+ Years in Catholic School Development</i></b>
<p>
Although Part II will not be following the textbook and workbook lesson by lesson as we did in Part I, we will be referring to various parts and exercises of both, so if you did not purchase them in the Part I course, you can still get them from NCEA. Here are the links:
