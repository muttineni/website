<p class="center"><b>Bishop Bosco's 'On Bended Knee' Focus for Online Seminar</b></p>
<p class="center">By Angela J. Burrows, Executive Director, Infomedia Services</p>
<p>GREENSBURG – Nearly four years after it was issued, Bishop Emeritus Anthony G. Bosco's pastoral letter, &quot;On Bended Knee: The Eucharist and Service,&quot; continues to resonate with readers. For this reason, it is being used as the focus of a seminar being offered by the University of Dayton's Virtual Learning Community for Faith Formation (VLCFF).</p>
<p>Registration for the three-week seminar is going very well, according to Richard Drabik, multimedia coordinator for Dayton's Institute for Pastoral Initiatives, which houses the VLCFF initiative. To register for the seminar, which begins Feb. 27, visit the VLCFF Web site at <?php print vlc_internal_link('http://vlc.udayton.edu/') ?>. Drabik said those registered for the seminar to date are from as far away as the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and as close as the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston in West Virginia.</p>
<p>&quot;We recognize the value and quality of what the bishop has written,&quot; Drabik said. &quot;It's a powerful document. We wanted to extend it to our partners,&quot; he said of the 26 dioceses that participate in the VLCFF. (The Diocese of Greensburg is one of the 26 partners.)</p>
<p>Sister Angela Ann Zukowski of the Mission Helpers of the Sacred Heart who holds a doctorate in ministry and is director of the institute, applauded &quot;On Bended Knee&quot; for its pastoral presentation of the Eucharist. She said she was especially interested in presenting a seminar on the Eucharist at this time in light of the fact that the church is in the midst of the Year of the Eucharist, as declared by Pope John Paul II.</p>
<p>&quot;On Bended Knee,&quot; with its video component, shows us in a very concrete way what it means to be Eucharist to each other, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;This video can speak to many different age groups, as will the content of this seminar,&quot; Sister Angela Ann, said, adding that when the Mass is ended, we are to go out and be Eucharist, which means serving each other.</p>
<p>The VLCFF's three-week programs are designed for those who are interested in growing in their faith. Generally, about a quarter of those who participate in the VLCFF's classes are religious education teachers involved in catechetical programs; another quarter are Catholic school religion teachers; and, of those remaining, about half are involved in some other type of ministry and half are interested in enhancing their personal faith life. Many of the latter group entered the church through the Right of Christian Initiation for Adults program.</p>
<p>Noting that Bishop Bosco will serve as the primary facilitator for the &quot;On Bended Knee&quot; seminar, Sister Angela Ann said he has become a very popular facilitator for the VLCFF. Many course participants have never had one-on-one contact with a bishop until they encounter Bishop Bosco. Many report that their encounter with him has intensified their faith, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;What he (Bishop Bosco) is doing is profound.&quot;</p>
