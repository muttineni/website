<ul>
  <li>Offered with diocesan partnership<br>
    </li>
  <li>Minimum of 8 students (max of 14)<br>
    </li>
  <li>No additional discounts<br>
    </li>
  <li>The course will occur within the normal VLCFF Cycle Calendar but you may have any course in the course list (even courses not listed 
      in your cycle of choice)<br>
	</li>
  <li>Students can share books if preferred. Best price is usually on amazon.com<br>
    </li>
  <li>If you wish, we will try to arrange for a facilitator from your diocese (cannot guarantee, but we will try).<br>
    </li>
  <li>Once a closed section is agreed upon, here is the procedure:</li>
  	</ul>
	<p>1. Provide Richard R. Drabik with a list of names of those who will be in the course(s)<br>
	   2. Indicate if a local facilitator is preferred<br>
	   3. You will inform the students that all they need to do is create a profile at the VLCFF site (they DO NOT need to register)<br>
	   4. You will inform the students of any required books<br>
	   5. As Richard sees the profiles created, he will place the students in the reserved section<br>
	   6. As the start date gets closer Richard will keep you informed about the status of registration<br>
	   7. Everything else will follow a normal VLCFF Cycle schedule<br />
       8. It is preferred that students pay individually. If the parish or organization intends on covering the cost you are advised to refund students only after successful completion of the course. This will ensure full and active participation. If you wish to make arrangements for a bulk pay contact the VLCFF staff. </p>
	
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> If possible, have the students meet as a group in person about a week before the course begins. If the facilitator is local, the facilitator can be invited as well. the group can get to know each other and talk about expectations for the course. After the course is over the group may want to meet again within two weeks to talk about the experience and share new ideas and insights<br></p>

<br>

<p>Feel free to dream new things. We are all in this together and constantly looking for new ways to expand the experience and process.</p>
