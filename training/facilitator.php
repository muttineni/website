             One letter of recommendation should come from the ordinary (bishop) where the person applying
             to be a facilitator currently resides or a person at the 
             director level who can speak to the character and faith of the Facilitator in Training (FT). 
             The second letter of recommendation can come from someone at the parish level or diocesan
             level where the person resides. The recommendation letters should speak to the competencies, interpersonal, 
             communication and conflict-resolution skills of the FT. The FT must have a profile on the
             VLCFF website. If the FT has taken courses already as a student, then a profile exists
             (a second profile is <strong>not</strong> needed to become a facilitator). Go to the
             VLCFF website at <a target="_blank" href="http://vlc.udayton.edu">http://vlc.udayton.edu</a> to create
             a profile.
         </li><br />
       	<li>
         	An important aspect of being a quality VLCFF facilitator is knowing what it is like to experience a VLCFF course from a student perspective.
             You may pick any course in our regular offerings. Check the online calendar to figure out when you want to take a course. 
             You are not required to pay the course fee. When you register simply skip the payment request and let Richard Drabik know that you have selected your course 
             (<a href="mailto:rdrabik1@udayton.edu">RDrabik1@udayton.edu</a>). <br /><br />
             If there are any required books we ask that you try to get them on your own. 
             However, if you are not able to acquire or borrow any required books they will be provided at no cost to you. 
             As a facilitator in training you are REQUIRED to participate fully and successfully complete the course. 
             Until this step is completed you will not be able to go on to take the FIT (Facilitator In Training) seminar.
         </li><br />
       	<li>
         	Sign up for and complete the Facilitator in Training (FIT) seminar, <i>Role and Ministry
               of Online Facilitators</i>, under the direction of Sr. Angela Ann Zukowski. The FT must 
             submit his/her name to Richard Drabik to be placed in the seminar. This is not a seminar 
             the FT can self-register for.
         </li><br />
       	<li>
         	After successfully completing the FIT seminar and gaining the approval of Sr. Angela 
             Ann Zukowski, the FT must submit facilitation competencies. The link can be found on this 
             page above this section under "Competencies." <i>Ensure that your <strong>name</strong> is put in the name box at the top of the page</i>. Checkmark every topic you are
             knowledgeable in and would like the opporunity to facilitate. A complete list of courses/
             seminars with their respected summary is found at <a href="http://vlc.udayton.edu/courses/courses.php?group by track=1"> http://vlc.udayton.edu/courses/courses.php?group by track=1</a>.
         </li><br />
       	<li>
         	 Once the above stages are complete, the FT is ready to facilitate for the first
             time. Richard Drabik will notify the FT and Margee McCrate will provide any necessary
             materials. The FT will be shadowed by Sr. Angela Ann Zukowski to offer feedback and be
             available to answer any questions that arise.<br />

        </ul>
      </li> <br />  
      <li>
      	Can a student finish a course by picking up where they left off?<br />
         a. No. even when a student has a very valid reason for dropping
         a course, they will need to start at the beginning when they
         re-register. <br />
      </li> <br />  
      <li>
      	What do I tell a student regarding credits or refunds?<br />
         a. Please refer the student directly to Angela Hall (<a href="mailto:AHall1@udayton.edu">AHall1@udayton.edu</a>).
         We have a strict criteria on this issue, including the student's
         past history with the VLCFF. The facilitator should not even
         mention the possibility of a credit or refund. <br />
      </li><br />   
      <li>
      	Can I extend the course deadline for students who need extra time
         to complete their course work?<br />
         a. It is possible toe extend the course deadline by a few days, 
         however, this is discouraged. When a course deadline is extended,
         it causes a delay in printing of certificates and issuing 
         stipends. <br />
      </li> <br />  
      <li>
      	What do I tell a student who does not have their textbook at the 
         beginning of the course?<br />
         a. It could be that the student was a 'last minute' registration,
         and they have ordered from Amazon.com. If the expected ship date 
         from Amazon.com is into the second week of the course, the student
         should contact Margee McCrate (<a href="mailto:mmccrate1@udayton.edu">MMCcrate1@udayton.edu</a>) to request that a book be 
         sent to them from the VLCFF and they should cancel their Amazon.com
         order.
      </li> <br />  
      <li>
      	Do students have access to the scoring rubric so they know what is
         expected of them?<br />
         a. Yes. The scoring rubric is available on the home page, under
         the 'courses' tab, then the 'basic information' tab.
      </li> <br />  
      <li>
      	When can I expect to receive my stipend for facilitating a course?<br />
         a. Your stipend should arrive within 4-6 weeks after the cycle 
         has ended.
      </li>  <br /> 
      <li>
      	What is the stipend for facilitation?
         <br />
         a. Five week courses: $450.00. Seminars (3 week classes) $200.00.
